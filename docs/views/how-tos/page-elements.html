      <p class="nhsuk-body-l">The NHS.UK digital service manual provides lots of CSS classes for styling page elements, so you should not need to write as much of your own Sass or CSS.</p>

      <p>You can change things like the font size or the spacing between elements using the utility classes.</p>
      
      <p>Explore the <a href="https://beta.nhs.uk/service-manual/styles-components-patterns">NHS.UK digital service manual</a> to see what classes are available and how to apply them.</p>
